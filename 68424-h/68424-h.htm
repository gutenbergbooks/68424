<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the evening of Christmas Day. The
hymn of “Peace upon earth, good-will towards
men,” had been chanted by thousands of voices
throughout the land, from the grand cathedral-choir
to the simple singers of the village
church. Charity had extended her munificent
hand to the poor and needy, lighting up smiles
on many a care-worn face. Hospitality welcomed
the good, the beautiful, and the great
to the lordly mansions of the rich. Love and
Peace sat enthroned in many a happy home.
Poverty, shivering at the present, was consoled
by the glowing figure of Hope, pointing with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
radiant eyes to the future. Memory and Sorrow
lingered around the grave of many a departed
one; but of all mourners they were the
saddest who were estranged from those they still
loved. Yes, amid the pain, the sorrow, the suffering
of life, <i>their</i> hearts were the heaviest; for
(to use the oft-quoted words of the poet) “to
be wroth with those we love, doth work like
madness in the brain;” and this hallowed season
speaks strongest to our kindest feelings, and
to the tenderness of our better nature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A train had stopped at a rough little village
station about thirty miles from town, and a
few country people, on their way home, leaned
over the bridge above to admire the enormous
red eyes of the monster as it moved slowly on
through a deep cutting crowned with dark
firs. They lingered yet a moment longer, to
mark whom it had borne from the great city
to their quiet village. A beautiful girl of fifteen,
glowing with health and exercise, accompanied
by two fine, rough-looking dogs, rushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
down to meet her playfellows and friends. She
was breathless with joy, and with her race over
the heath; but her merry laugh and warm
greeting sounded pleasantly enough as the
noise of the train died away in the distance.</p>

<p>A lady, wrapped in a warm plaid, who had
been anxiously waiting for some time, took the
arm of her husband, with a few low words of
delighted welcome, and they walked briskly
away. The dogs of the younger party barked
with glee—were patted and caressed. One
look at the dear heath and at the hills beyond,
with a thrill of delight at the thoughts of a
long ramble over them on the morrow, and the
ponies were mounted, the dogs whistled to,
and away flew the happy trio to the home-welcome,
to the dear old hall, to all the joy
of a Christmas meeting.</p>

<p>Only two other passengers appeared, winding
up the pathway—a gentleman of tall and
commanding aspect, and a buxom, brisk-footed
countrywoman, wrapped in her scarlet cloak,
who passed him with a low curtsey and cheerful
good night. She was thinking of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
bright fireside, of the dear little faces round it
anxiously awaiting her return, and of the enormous
amount of joy contained in that wicker
basket. An event of great marvel and wonderment
is a poor woman’s visit to her friends in
town, and she is ever in a tearful state of
ecstasy and excitement on reaching home again;
all of which becomes a matter of grave family
history in the lowly household, and is recounted
on many an occasion to eager and attentive
hearers.</p>

<p>She quickly disappeared up a winding path
cut through the furze and heather, evidently
leading to a low-roofed cottage on the skirts
of a fir-wood. Lights twinkled in the casement,
and joyful voices were soon heard approaching
to meet and welcome her. The road
was now perfectly solitary. A few deep-red
clouds still hung over the west, and here and
there a large bright star shone silently through
the sharp, pure air. Dogs bayed in the distance;
the sound came very pleasantly over
the heather through the rough old pines.</p>

<p>The gentleman walked briskly on, and lights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
began to appear in the valley beneath. He
stopped as the merry notes of a flageolet struck
his ear, proceeding from a cottage by the road-side.
The blaze of a wood fire within illumined
the little rustic porch and neat garden. Bright
branches of glistening holly shone in the tiny
casement. The tune ceased, and was followed
by a light-hearted laugh and the sound of young
voices.</p>

<p>“How happy they seem!” said he. “It is
such scenes as these which make the country
so delightful, so cheering to sense and spirit!”</p>

<p>And yet he sighed heavily as he walked on;
and passing through an avenue of fir and larch
leading to one of the prettiest and most picturesque
cottages in the world, he paused
when he reached the garden-gate. It seemed,
too, a dear, quiet, sweet-smelling home. Lights
shone from more than one of the windows;
and more than one bright young face might
be seen, by the gleam of its golden hair, flitting
about in the uncertain light. A sweet
young voice singing as sweet a tune ceased, as
all young voices do, suddenly, when the bell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
rang out its summons, and a brisk, rosy little
maid appeared, lantern and key in hand, to
admit the traveller, and guide him through
the long shadow of the firs to the house. A
favourite dog bounded to meet and gambol
round him with unrepressed joy. The children
clustered into the porch to say, timidly,
“How do you do?” and hold out their little
hands to shake; while their mother, advancing
with a kindly greeting, expressed her pleasure
at his return. Even the maid looked pleased
and happy to see him. But yet it was not his
home.</p>

<p>After a few minutes’ conversation, the traveller
was seated in his own room, his dog, his
sole companion, looking at him with glistening
eyes, as his master fondly stroked his magnificent
head. He was a man of twenty-eight
or thirty years of age, with a sad and thoughtful
cast of countenance, yet one that all who looked
upon it <i>must</i> instantly love and respect; it was
at once so engaging and so noble. He looked
round his little room at his sketches and his
gun with evident pleasure, placed some books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
and papers which he had brought on a little
table before him, and drawing his arm-chair
close to the blazing pine-logs, sat watching the
golden cones as they crumbled away, one by
one, at the height of their brilliancy. But every
reverie must have its end; and his was brought
to a close by the appearance of coffee, borne
by a bright-eyed country maid, smirking and
smiling with pleasure, as country servants are
wont to do at every fresh arrival.</p>

<p>It would seem that the reverie by the bright
fireside was not an idle one, but that among
many revolving thoughts, some, at least, were
considered worthy of preservation; for the coffee
was soon despatched, the table covered with
books and papers, and the stranger intently
occupied with his pen.</p>

<p>So absorbed did he become with it, that
after one or two long, wistful glances, the
fine hound lay down reproachfully on his comfortable
rug, as if despairing of any further
notice that night.</p>

<p>The wind moaned heavily in the pine-branches
round the cottage. Presently the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
writer paused and listened to the sound, so
like the rushing of distant waters. He walked
slowly to the window, and gazed long and earnestly
into the night. It was moonlight, yet
stormy; and large, glittering stars, looked
down through the dark branches, when the
hurrying white clouds had drifted over them.
The distant clock of the old village church,
slowly striking the hour, sounded mournfully
over the river; and the lonely man at that
little window thought of years that were gone,
of the bright firesides in many a happy home
that night, and turned and put away his papers
with a sigh. He thought how differently he
used to work years ago, when, with all the
ardour of his nature and the energy of hope,
and yet with intense fear and anxiety, he strove
to render himself worthy of one idolized, one
long-sighed-for object! He thought, too, of the
bitterness, the agony of disappointment; and
how long years of his young life would have
been thrown away, had he not struggled hard
to save himself from becoming a useless, melancholy
being, given up to the indulgence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
selfish regrets. He had succeeded,—there was
some comfort in that reflection. He knew of
what he was capable, and dared not throw away
the power he had acquired, because it no longer
availed the idol Self. So he still worked on.
He had become distinguished for his literary
labours, and for his contributions to the improvement
and well-being of his fellow-creatures;
but to fame and to the praises of the
great he was now equally indifferent. His happiest
hours were passed in his favourite village,
where he was greatly beloved, although he dared
not wholly give himself up to the quiet of a
country life.</p>

<p>He had had the old Gothic church restored,
with all possible observance of its antique ornaments
and its fine clustering ivy; and took a kind
of Sir Roger de Coverley delight in seeing the
country people, bettered and improved in every
way, flocking to it on Sundays to hear his good
tutor’s sermons, to which he used to listen
with so much reverence in his boyish days.
He had learned to believe that the word “happiness”
signifies, the being reconciled to bear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
still having courage to do, and gratitude to enjoy
that which remains. Thus, he was usually
cheerful in his various occupations; <i>but this
was Christmas time</i>: a time when the lonely
heart feels most desolate—a time when many
a tender word spoken by the absent is
remembered with sorrow—when all anger is
forgotten in the feeling of peace and love which
steals over the heart. And his head lay buried
in his hands, his whole soul given up to an
overwhelming agony of regret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p class="illoright"><i>Day &amp; Son, lith<sup>rs</sup> to the Queen.</i></p>
</div>

<p>“This day last year,” he muttered, “who
could have believed the change? Oh, Edith!”
he continued, taking up a miniature that lay
beside him, “who could have thought then
that we should now be as strangers to each
other? Who could have thought that that
bright face, those many noble qualities, could
have wrought so much misery?” Again he
looked at the lovely countenance, smiling on
him a thousand of the tenderest remembrances,
and a still gentler expression, a kindlier spirit,
came over him. “Those eyes,” he said, “how
softly they have looked on me! Perhaps even
now a thought——but what folly! In the pride
of beauty and prosperity, what is there to
remind her of me?”</p>

<p>A low tap at the door interrupted his meditations.
For an instant he could not say,
“Come in!” his heart was so very full; but
quickly recovering himself, he turned with a
smile to welcome a little village child, who
timidly advanced to place both her tiny hands
in his.</p>

<p>She looked into his face with eyes beaming
with love and gratitude; but the joyful,
sparkling expression soon faded away, for she
saw that he was sadder than usual; and with
the quick sympathy and natural grace of childhood
she sat down quietly on the rug, and
taking the stately head of the hound on her lap,
pensively stroked his long, shaggy coat. Presently
she ventured to break the silence in her
gentle way—“I am so glad you are come back,
sir; I have missed you so!”</p>

<p>Her companion’s countenance brightened,
and he said with animation—“Have you,
though, my poor little Mary? I thought you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
had forgotten me, being so long away.” And
he stroked her bright brown hair.</p>

<p>“You should not have thought that,” said
the child, earnestly; “I always remember you,
for you taught me all I know. I was longing
to come yesterday, and all day to-day,” she
continued, “to hear if you had arrived. To-day
has been so happy that I could not stay
away any longer, and so here I am,” she
added, with her merry laugh, which sounded
pleasantly in that usually silent room. These
simple words, that mute caress, had restored
the confidence of the two friends. Mary
was herself again, full of fun and prattle.
Seated on the extreme edge of a huge Gothic
chair, she balanced her little feet on the back
of her friend Troy, who, far from resenting the
liberty, fixed his dark eyes lovingly on her
sweet young face, while she talked on, full of
the details of her simple life. How she had
gathered pine-cones for several evenings, because
she knew he loved their cheerful blaze
and sweet smell. How poor Turpin, who was
always in trouble, had hunted a rabbit, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
been caught in a trap; of her mad race over the
hills for help; how she nursed the poor, poor
foot afterwards; and how the faithful patient
cried because he could not accompany her
that night; the relation of all which very much
affected his kind little mistress. Presently she
produced with great glee her “Christmas present,”—several
little bundles of bark, peeled
with great care, from the silver birch-trees,
cut into slips, and tied with red worsted.
“I burnt a little bit the other day,” said she,
“and the smell was so nice I thought you
would like it, so I got some to light your taper
with—do try it;” and the little creature soon
held a blazing piece in her hand.</p>

<p>“It is delicious, Mary; and how good of you
to collect it for me!”</p>

<p>“I was very happy getting it,” said the
child; “but I wish you had not thought I
had forgotten you. I could not forget you!”
she continued, after a pause; “you, who have
been so good to me, and taught me so much!
I never looked at a book before you came.
Oh, I was sadly wild! Mother said I made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
more noise than the boys!” And she laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>The tutor laughed too, and told the often
repeated story, which he knew she loved to
hear, of how, in his walks, he had frequently
listened to her little voice singing in a cornfield,
while “minding” birds; how he had
been surprised at her sudden disappearance on
his nearer approach, and on making a voyage
of discovery, had found her ensconced in
the body of a broken-down post-chaise, that,
singularly enough, lay between two old fir-trees
at the foot of the wood! He did not
describe to her how, in imagination, he had
pictured the different and exciting scenes in
which the once gay equipage might have
borne its part; but went on to say how he
had peeped in unobserved, and had seen her
perched on one of the dilapidated seats, with a
little piece of board on her lap, intently occupied
in carving a morsel of meat into divers
small pieces, which she divided, with impartial
care, among three ragged starlings perched
on the opposite beam, who watched her with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
glistening eyes! How merrily she talked to
them, and how perfectly they seemed to love
and understand each other! He reminded
her of her surprise on being discovered, and
her frank invitation to the intruder to “look
in” on the wonders of the unique aviary, with
its valuable illustrations of the “History of
Red Riding Hood,” its bright jay’s feathers,
and other childish treasures!</p>

<p>Heartily the little Mary laughed; and so
the Christmas evening passed on.</p>

<p>“I must go now,” she said; “I promised
to read mother the pretty story you gave me,
‘Simple Susan,’ and they will all sit up for
it! Good bye! You will promise not to be so
sad when I am gone as you were when I came
in. You have been thinking of that pretty
lady again!” she said, with a face of anxious
love—pointing to the miniature—“that makes
you so, I know! Why don’t you go to her?”</p>

<p>“Because she does not love me, Mary,”
was the faltering reply; “and you know we
are not happy with those who do not love us.”</p>

<p>“Are you <i>sure</i> of that?” said the child,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
earnestly. “People often hide their kindest
thoughts—and perhaps she hides hers from
you; you must look for them, as I look for
violets, in their thick leaves. Oh, I was so
unhappy once!” she continued, tears starting
into her eyes at the remembrance: “I quarrelled
with my brother, and we did not speak
all day—both were so proud: but do you
know” (and the sweet little face sparkled)
“that when I put my arms round his neck
and kissed him, and said, ‘Good night,
Harry!’ he kissed me, and cried too; and
said how unhappy he had been <i>all</i> the time.
I had thought he would <i>never</i>, <i>never</i> love me
again! Oh! if my brother had died, as
baby did, before we kissed each other that
night!”</p>

<p>Poor little Mary paused, her heart quite
full at the bare idea of such a thing; but
she turned again, with admiring eyes, to the
miniature. “She looks very kind and good,
and <i>so</i> beautiful! Did you speak gently,
and ask her to love you again: or were you
proud?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>The child did not notice the agitation of
her companion, and little did she imagine
that, long after her head lay softly on her
happy pillow, the simple eloquence of those
Magic Words was working powerfully in his
heart!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Over</span> many a mile of hard, frosty road, by
snow-clad fields and hills and woods, by many
an ice-bound stream, must we lead the imagination
of our reader on the evening of the
same Christmas Day, and peep into another
home, far from that we have just quitted.</p>

<p>Undrawing the warm crimson curtains of
a charming little room—half drawing-room,
half library—the light of a lamp falls brightly
on the figure of a lady reading to her husband.
It is manuscript, and he puts the pages by for
her as she goes on.</p>

<p>She often pauses, to look up with a delighted
smile at his praises, and he thinks that she
never looked so beautiful before! She is very
like Correggio’s Magdalen, and has the same
lovely countenance and waving hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Presently she came to the last page, and
the praise was repeated.</p>

<p>“I had no idea I could translate so well,”
said she, “and am glad you like it, for that
will give me spirits to go on: I may, in time,
become quite useful to you.”</p>

<p>“When are you not everything to me?”
was the reply. “But, Marion, you must not
work so hard; I cannot afford to see you look
one bit less bright. Besides, it is a kind of
reproach to me your working so much; indeed
you must not!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Marion, laughing; “you
can’t think how happy I am when helping
you, for I am sure you are often very weary!
Poor Edward! what anxiety I have caused
you! Now for a volley of protestations!”
said she, laughing again. “But to be serious:
I was thinking, to-day, how much we have to
be thankful for; and that with all its anxieties
how happy this year has been—how <i>infinitely</i>
happier, working and striving on together,
than droning through an insipid life of ease,
as some do. I don’t know what would become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
of me if you were ever to be rich,” she
continued; “to be sure, one might always
find some useful employment, some good to be
done; but no one knows, except those who
have experienced it, the delight of overcoming
difficulties, and earning home comforts by
one’s own exertions.”</p>

<p>“True, dear Marion! I never knew, until
I knew you, how little is necessary for happiness!”</p>

<p>“I knew what life was—I had an anxious
one at home, even from a little child,” said
Marion, “and adversity taught me to know
what is best worth knowing; what flowers to
gather in this great garden, that many neglect,
or do not perceive. How sweet are the uses
of adversity! I love to linger on those words;
and if ever I venture to write an essay,” said
she, smiling, “it shall be on that subject.
What does it not teach us?—the practice of
almost every virtue.”</p>

<p>“Nay, not quite so far, enthusiast,” said
her husband, smiling; “remember the effect
of almost constant sun on flowers; how splendid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
they become—how fully their beauty is
developed!”</p>

<p>“Yes; but they cannot bear the storm that
<i>may</i>, that <i>must</i> come. The stout old thistle,
reared in cold and sleet, is much better off—much
more useful, and protects many a little
plant under its vigorous leaves. Now, only
think what adversity really does for us. To
begin with <i>my</i> early life:—my father and
mother treated me as their friend in all their
troubles; I was accustomed to watch their
anxious care-worn faces, to try to cheer them,
and to rejoice when they brightened: this
bound us together in the closest affection; I
believe no child, no parents, were ever so dear to
each other. No little home was ever so loved as
mine; and I was quite broken-hearted when
away from all its cares, even for a short time,
although in the midst of what people called
enjoyment. These were very different feelings
from those of children nursed in the lap of
affluence, who are frequently selfish, and often
but little attached to those around them. I
knew what it was to be deprived of many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
comforts, which made me grateful for those I
had, and taught me to feel for the sufferings
of others infinitely worse off than myself.
Naturally impetuous, I grew up patient; for,
as you know, my father was a man of eccentric
genius, who failed in all his efforts to place us
in the brilliant position he dreamed of. I felt
and shared in his disappointments, until disappointment
itself became powerless! Sympathy
with those I loved roused me to exertion—taught
me the value of time—the dignity of
usefulness! But, above all, the frowns of the
world, the sweet uses of adversity, made me
feel the dear necessity of clinging to and
loving one another, and of living in that
‘peace which passeth all understanding!’”</p>

<p>Marion paused, and looked with inexpressible
tenderness on her husband.</p>

<p>“I do not believe we should have loved each
other half so well if we had not borne so much
anxiety together,” she presently continued,
“although it would be a dangerous experiment
for those to try, who never knew what care
was! <i>We</i> very coolly stepped into its troubled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
waters. What straits we have been in! There
is really some amusement, though, in looking
back to a hundred comical little difficulties,
mingled with graver trials; in peeping into
the crowded picture-gallery of one’s own life—grave
and gay! Do you remember when we
were so <i>very</i> poor, and your father’s friends,
the Saviles, condescended to drive over to
luncheon with us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Edward, laughing; “when
poor old Jock behaved so inconsiderately!”</p>

<p>“Inconsiderately, indeed,” said Marion,
laughing too. “I shall never forget seeing him
swallow the delicacies which I had prepared
with so much care, in the coolest manner
possible, looking me hard in the face all the
time. I was in an agony to see the ham
sandwiches disappear one after another down
his huge throat (knowing there were no more
in the house, too), while the capricious fine
lady who took a fancy to feed him, drawled
out, ‘the d-e-a-r d-o-g! <i>how</i> he li-kes them!’
I should think he did, indeed, with his appetite!
I do believe, though, Mr. Edward, that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
like all men, you rather enjoyed the scene than
otherwise; for you never offered to put the
cruel old dog out of the room.”</p>

<p>“How could I tear him from the flattering
attentions of his Patroness? But let me see;
how did you manage it, Marion? I dare say
very ingeniously and gracefully. I remember
how proud I felt of you that day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I appeared to enter into the amusement
and drollery of his enormous appetite,
but suggested, in the most affectionate manner
possible, that he should <i>bow</i> his thanks to
the fair lady before tasting another morsel!
Poor Jock, who had not the slightest acquaintance
with any feat or accomplishment of the
kind, was all amazement at my gestures and
commands, and only stared hard for more;
whereupon he was gently ‘<i>fie-fied</i>,’ and put
out of the room for his obstinacy and ingratitude!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>
<div class="bbox">
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/facing025.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="illoright"><i>Day &amp; Son, lith<sup>rs</sup> to the Queen.</i></p>
</div>

<p>They both laughed heartily at the remembrance
of Jock’s delinquency and its punishment;
and Marion being in a very merry
humour, recounted with much mirth many
other similar incidents, which they <i>could</i> laugh
at now. “We never deceived each other but
once,” said she; “the time when you were so ill,
you know, from over-work, and I used to steal
slily into the village to give your Latin lessons
to those stupid boys you were ‘preparing!’ I
often wonder how I took courage to ask their
mother to let me take your place: yet I am
glad I did, for I don’t know what we should
have done without the money; and I studied
the lessons so well myself, that I did no injustice
to your pupils. But then the <i>dénouement</i>!
I shall never forget your walking into that
dingy library, pale as death, and your extreme
surprise on finding me seated in the great chair,
conjugating a tremendous Latin verb, while the
poor little mamma looked on with amazement at
my proficiency! <i>I</i> was startled too, fully believing
you to be quietly resting on the sofa,
<i>while I took my walk</i>!”</p>

<p>“We both looked very guilty for an instant.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we did indeed; and I thought I
never should cease laughing on our way home,
especially as you were half inclined to be angry!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
But my mirth soon vanished when I saw how
faint you were, and you rested your head on
my shoulder as we sat on the stile. A terrible
fear came over me,” continued Marion, shuddering,
and drawing closer to her husband—“I
never felt pain like that before!”</p>

<p>Both were silent for some time; and
Edward tenderly stroked the beautiful head
bent down beside him. “Nay, look up,
Marion,” he said; “I am quite well now, love,
and you must not be so sad.”</p>

<p>“I am not sad,” said Marion, raising her
large eyes, and smiling gently. “I was thinking
how grateful I am that you are better,
and how happy this Christmas would be if you
were but reconciled to your father.”</p>

<p>“Every house has its spectre, Marion, and
this haunts ours. I believe one always feels any
kind of estrangement from those near to us
most powerfully on days like these. They seem
to have a strange mysterious power of calling
up old recollections and early affections!”</p>

<p>“Only those which ought never to be broken
come at this holy time,” said Marion; “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
gentle thoughts it brings with it seem to me
like the soft warning of angel voices,—to be
at peace ere it is too late! I wish you would
read them so, and write to your mother again:
she is of a gentler nature; but they must—yes,
they both must, long to see you again!—Oh,
if I could but persuade you!” she continued,
with emotion: “we know not what a day may
bring forth—even to the youngest and strongest
among us; and Mrs. Hope says they both
seem to ‘age’ very much. How deeply you
would grieve through life if——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Marion, say no more!” exclaimed
her husband in an agitated voice, “it is that
thought which so constantly haunts me. For
myself, I could forget all; but their unkindness
to you—to you, of whom they ought to
have been so proud; I cannot forget that!”</p>

<p>“Do not think of it,” said Marion, in a
soothing tone; “we must not quarrel with
people because they are unable to see things in
the same light as ourselves. They knew very
little of me, and thought, I dare say, that I
prevented your being much happier with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
wealthier bride: besides, they may love me yet
when you have made your peace, as I know
you will,” said she, smiling. “Remember, it
is to your parents that you bend, and I never
can feel happy while you are as a stranger to
them. I suppose it would be my turn next,”
said she, with her musical laugh, “if I were
to venture to oppose your wishes, or to say a
few angry words.”</p>

<p>“Marion!” said her husband reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Well, what security have I,” was the playful
retort, “over one who could be contented
under such circumstances? You owe to them
infinitely more than you do to me—they loved
you for years and years before I did. Oh,
Edward! your own heart must tell you more
than I could ever speak.”</p>

<p>“We will not discuss the subject any further,
dear Marion,” said he, and his voice
faltered. “Sing to me, will you? The evening
never seems perfect without a song from
you.”</p>

<p>Marion sang the following lines in a rich
and lovely voice:—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the exception of the young and
thoughtless, who only look forward to a season
of festivity and enjoyment, and of the callous
and indifferent, who seldom think of such
matters at all, the varied feelings which hail
the approach of Christmas may be compared
to those occasioned by the contemplation of
advancing age—of age so different in its
aspects, whether we behold our fellow-mortals
sinking down into the vale of years alone,
neglected and unloved; alienated from kindred
and friends, and still retaining the unholy
animosities of earlier years; unsubdued by
religion, unsupported by the contemplation of
a useful and virtuous life; or, on the contrary,
surrounded by loved and loving hearts,
looking back with gratitude and pleasure to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the past, and with hope and resignation to the
future, in peace, and love, and charity with all!
Many a family in embarrassed circumstances,
many a poor widow with a “limited income,”
looks on the increased expenses of this season
of the year, on its bills and various claims,
with the same feelings which anticipate the
infirmities of declining years and sharp attacks
of rheumatism and gout. Many look forward
to increased domestic comfort, and brighter
firesides. Many a mother smiles with delight
on her children, all assembled round her once
more. Many a father rejoices in their joyous
laughter, or in the affection and reverence of
maturer age. Many an old friend is welcomed
to the social board. But, alas! there are many,
too, who look back with a dreary regret to the
years that are gone, and think, how different
Christmas Day seems now to what it was!</p>

<p>Such melancholy thoughts were revolving in
the mind of a man of dignified and venerable
aspect, pacing gloomily up and down the splendid
library of a fine old mansion. It was almost
dark, and the glare of the fire played over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
rich volumes, and on the antique carving of
the furniture. He looked with a sigh at the
hearth, once crowded with happy faces. One
only remained, and ah! how changed from the
blooming figure of earlier days, which rose
before him! How feebly that once beautiful
head lay on the rich velvet cushion of her
chair! How much suffering and sorrow might
be traced on that furrowed brow! He felt
that her reverie was as sad as his own; and
truly too, for she was thinking of many a fair
child that had gone down to the tomb in all
the promise of early youth!—of the pride and
joy of seeing them assembled at Christmas,
well and happy!—of the joyous holiday-makings
and merry meetings!—of the tearful
partings, and the agony of those final ones,
when the thin, small hand, pressed in its tiny
grasp the last life greeting!</p>

<p>Still she could think of the departed with the
softened and resigned feelings which religion
and time never fail to produce. But that which
fell most heavily on her heart and darkened her
declining years, was, that the last and only surviving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
one—the boy whom she had loved best—whom
she had watched over with such intense
fear and anxiety—was still a stranger from his
father’s home. Month after month passed, and
still both, in their pride, hung back from any
attempt at a reconciliation. She felt that many
more might not elapse before she would be far
beyond the reach of mediation, and with a mother’s
and a wife’s love she longed to see them
united again ere she departed. Presently she
walked to the window, and laid her thin white
hand on the arm of her husband.</p>

<p>“I see you still love to watch the rooks
going to rest in the old elm-trees.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sir John, hastily; “it is amusing
to watch their odd flights, and to imagine
you can distinguish the croak of a particular
bird.” He would not say that it was Edward’s
favourite pastime when a boy, but
his companion knew well that he <i>thought</i>
of the time when both used to stand there
together. “But who is this coming up the
avenue?” he said at length, as if willing to
shake off the chain of thought. “Mrs. Hope,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
I fancy, by her black dress. I suppose she is
come to tell us all about the dinner, as she
promised.”</p>

<p>No door ever opened on a better, or kinder,
or more zealous village schoolmistress, than
did this stately one on the spare, timid little
body who now advanced. No one ever looked
more placidly happy, and no one more pleased
and grateful, when she was kindly placed in
the most comfortable of chairs by Sir John,
and welcomed with a cordial smile by his
lady.</p>

<p>“I came up to tell you, sir, that everything
was done as you desired. The children were
<i>so</i> happy, it quite did one’s heart good to see
them. They all came in the morning with
evergreens and holly, and we made some beautiful
wreaths to set off the room. Their new
dresses look very nice, and they are truly
thankful to you for your kindness. The coals
and blankets, and other things, are all sent
home too, and many say they shall thank Sir
John for a happy Christmas; which they wish
in return, with all their hearts, I am sure,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
continued the good little woman, with emotion;
“for, thank God, <i>very</i> few among them are
ungrateful.”</p>

<p>Sir John’s benevolent countenance brightened
with pleasure as he listened to the kind
schoolmistress’s further recital of the village
festivities, to which he had contributed so
largely; and his wife marvelled how the heart
of so good a man could be so unrelenting as
she knew it was.</p>

<p>Perhaps similar thoughts were passing in the
mind of Mrs. Hope; for after she had told
all she ostensibly had to tell, and felt that
it was time for her to depart, she still lingered,
and yet hesitated to speak.</p>

<p>“Is there anything you wish to say to us,
Mrs. Hope?” said the lady, kindly; “pray
do not be afraid to mention anything in which
we can be of service to you. Is your son——”</p>

<p>“I thank your ladyship, I was not thinking
of him then, but of some one very different.
I thought you might like to know, and yet
was not sure—but Mr. Edward and his
lady came over to the school-house to-day,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
said she, as if from a desperate resolution,
“and my heart was quite full to see them
come and go away again like strangers—just at
Christmas time, too!” Poor little Mrs. Hope
trembled, for she saw that Sir John’s brow
darkened, and he drew back in his chair in an
agitated manner; but an encouraging look
from the lady re-assured her. “It was very
pleasant to see him again,” she continued,
“in the little parlour where he often used
to sit years ago, and give the prizes out to the
children, and speak encouragingly to them.
I thought he had forgotten the old place, and
all he was so good to; but he told me he had
been longing to see it, and never could feel so
happy anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“Poor Edward!” said the lady, with emotion.
“How does he look?”</p>

<p>“Very pale and delicate, ma’am; but just the
same as ever—just the same noble look,” said
Mrs. Hope, fast gathering courage, “although
not quite so joyful like as it used to be. He
made particular inquiries as to how his father
and mother looked, and seemed terribly cast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
down when I told him how poorly you had
both been.”</p>

<p>“Did he, indeed!” exclaimed Sir. John,
starting from his seat, and pacing up and
down; “why did you not let me know he was
with you?”</p>

<p>“I feared you did not wish to know it,”
was the reply. “But oh, Sir John! in my
humble way I did think it strange that, in an
erring world like this, your heart should be
turned from two such children!”</p>

<p>Tears were running fast down the face of
the good little schoolmistress. She hurried
away; but her Magic Words were not spoken
in vain.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beautifully</span> dawned the last morning of
the old year. How lovely are some few winter
sunrisings! A cold, grey sky, and dim, glimmering
light, scarcely reveals surrounding
objects. Presently a delicate blush appears,
gently stealing over the east. It deepens to a
ruddy glow; and then bright, golden clouds,
tinged with many a varied hue, overspread the
sky, lighting up in the strongest relief every
leafless tree, even to the most fibre-like branches.</p>

<p>Everything is very still. Edith sits silently
at the window of her dressing-room, watching
that lovely dawn. Presently a few starlings
appear on the frosty slopes, with their quick,
impatient gestures and rapid movements, seeking
a breakfast. A pair of beautiful blackbirds
droop their jetty wings, and seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
numbed with cold. A robin, cheerful even in
adversity, trills a few grateful notes on a shrub
near the window, and Edith thinks that no
new-year’s serenade could be half as touching
as that low, sweet song. She thinks, too, what
a lesson it teaches; for her melancholy eye
had been straying mournfully over the broad
lands stretching far and wide before her, and—“’tis
an old tale, and often told,”—she had
almost envied the humblest cottager in those her
lordly possessions. “Farewell, old year!” she
exclaimed; “none other will ever dawn upon
me as you did. May the new bear happiness
and joy to many! Oh, Marion! you little
thought how desolate I am, when you prophesied
that there was yet much in store for me.”</p>

<p>Marion’s picturesque cottage could be plainly
seen in the distance, shut in by the blue range
of hills above, and sheltered with sweeping
larches. The morning sun now shone brightly
upon it, and Edith pictured to herself the
beaming, happy countenance of her friend.</p>

<p>“May God bless you, Marion!” she continued
with emotion; “for to the example of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
your gentle goodness I owe all that is now left
me,—the knowledge of that usefulness, that
patient love and forbearance, which makes you
so dear to others, so happy in yourself, and
without which all that the world calls beauty
and talent is hollow and heartless indeed! You
taught me the value of true affection—the folly
and littleness of the false pride I rejoiced in;
and yet so sweetly, that I was only humbled
to myself—not to you. Would that it had
been but a few short months before! Oh,
Percy! how willingly would I now confess myself
in the wrong! But now I am forgotten!
In your benevolent plans, in your honourable
successes, there is no thought of me; or I am
only remembered as a wilful, imperious woman,
whom you once foolishly loved. I shall never
see you again—mine the sorrow, mine the
fault! But I am earning the right to self-esteem;
I am doing all that I believe you
would approve of, did you care for me now.”</p>

<p>Her heart was very full as she descended to
the breakfast-room. No one was there; but
on the table lay a simple nosegay. “From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Marion,” was written on a slip of paper. Edith
mentally thanked her friend for the love which
she knew was expressed in the fragrant gift;
but tears sprang into her eyes as she looked
on it; for a few lovely roses, the little blue
periwinkle, with its shining green leaves and
“sweet remembrances,” and a few early primroses
and violets, were arranged almost exactly
as she had received them from a still more
beloved hand the year before. She started
as her mother entered the room, and turned
hastily to conceal her emotion; but touched by
the look of anxious love which she caught
fixed on herself, exclaimed, while she suffered
the large tears to fall down her face, “Oh, my
mother, I will not be proud to <i>you</i>—Heaven
knows there would be little merit in that! I was
thinking”—and her beautiful head lay on her
mother’s gentle bosom—“of the happiness
which I have thrown away—of one who has
forgotten me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear child!” said her mother, as
she tenderly pressed her hand on the throbbing
brow, “in the doubtfulness of our nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
we often accuse those of forgetfulness whose
hearts may be breaking for our sake.”</p>

<p>Edith looked up, a sudden expression of joy
beaming over her countenance. As she bent
again over the flowers, the sweetest gleam of
hope stole over her, and she felt the magic
influence of those words.</p>

<p>Happy are they who in their own interests,
joys, and sorrows, forget not the welfare of
others! Edith looked forward with pleasure
to the events of the day; for in the morning
the school which she had built was to be
opened, with an appropriate address from the
good rector; and in the evening, young and
old, rich and poor, were to be assembled in her
splendid home. She had gaily declared to the
gentry her wish to receive, as lady of the
manor, “all good comers,” that New-Year’s
Eve; and to sup in the old hall of her ancestors,
after the manner of feudal times, with the peasantry
of her estate “below the salt.” They, of
course, looked forward to the event with unmixed
pleasure and delight. Not so all those
of gentler birth; for she had lived but little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
among them until of late, and was understood
still less. Many thought it a capricious whim
of the spoiled beauty, and many wondered what
strange thing she would do next. “It was not
that she cared more than the rest of them that
the poor should enjoy themselves, but that she
loved to do as no one else did. What a pity
her uncle’s fine estate was left in such hands!”</p>

<p>So charitably reasoned some of the invited
guests; but, happily, there were others who
knew Edith better, and welcomed with delight
her kind and benevolent plan for a happy new-year’s
eve to them all.</p>

<p>The important evening at last arrived. The
village children could not have existed much
longer. Wide were the park-gates flung open,
and never had the old avenue rung with the
sound of so many merry voices before. Many
a little belle startled a sleeping bird by stopping
under his resting-place to admire, by the
light of the lantern she carried, her bran
new shoes and pretty frock, wondering if any
of the great ladies would look half as nice,
and feel half as happy as she did. Some timid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
little creatures clung to their mothers’ skirts,
and looked with mingled feelings of awe and
admiration on the stately mansion, blazing with
light in the midst of the dark cedars, half
afraid of entering it until re-assured by the
promise of seeing the kind lady whom they all
loved. But when they arrived there, and were
welcomed by that sweet lady herself, who shook
hands with all, and wished them a happy new-year;
and when they saw the fine old hall
with its bright armour, and many magnificent
rooms all beautifully lighted up and decorated,
and were shown the pictures and other wonderful
things, their delight knew no bounds.
But, perhaps, that which charmed them most
was a deep recess at the lower end of the hall,
completely filled with rare and luxuriant plants,
in the midst of which stood a beautiful figure
of Peace, joining the hands of Anger and Contention,
who were regarding with a mingled
expression of surprise and admiration the heavenly
beauty which they had not perceived
when occupied with their unholy strife.</p>

<p>The children whispered softly here; for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
light was very dim, but a lovely glow irradiated
the beaming countenance of Peace, and here
and there flowers glistened in the dark leaves
around them.</p>

<p>And now tea and cake, such as they had
never tasted before, awaited them in a pretty
room, gay with laurel and holly, where our
friend Mrs. Hope presided, half beside herself
with joy, yet preserving the most perfect order
and decorum. Then the amusements of the
evening began, which comprised the merriest
and oddest of all styles of dancing to the music
of the village band, the wonders of a magic
lantern, and many a childish game beside; but
above all, the crowning delight was the new-year’s
gift to each of a pretty little volume,
with the name of each written in it by Edith’s
own hand.</p>

<p>The hours flew too swiftly by—so thought
these delighted little people, as ten o’clock was
announced, and Edith wished them all good
night as kindly as she had welcomed them; but
in few words, for carriages were arriving, and
she had to receive her guests: they thanked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
her in their simple way for the pleasure which
she had given them, and the homely sincerity
of their gratitude lighted her sweet face with
happy smiles.</p>

<p>The spacious picture-gallery, which had been
converted into a ball-room for the occasion,
was gay with many a shining wreath. The
old family portraits seemed to look down with
pleasure, and to beam a welcome on all assembled
there; so thought several of the wandering
villagers, grouped here and there amid the
more brilliant throng, watching the mazes of
the dance with interest and amazement, and
listening with equal surprise to the magnificent
band, to the music of which many a fairy foot
was flying. Most, however, thought it very
inferior to the performance of their own village
musicians, and wondered how people could
dance to such spiritless tunes on a new-year’s
eve like this.</p>

<p>Edith had anticipated their predilection,
their shyness, and their love of country-dances
and hornpipes; so they were soon marshalled
by their gentle chamberlain, Mrs.
Hope, into another room, where they could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
enjoy all these to their hearts’ content, and yet
feel themselves privileged to look in on the
grandees whenever they pleased. Perhaps
this room, with its unrestrained mirth and
merry laughter, was happier than the more
splendid one; for though many there were
thoroughly enjoying the beauty and gaiety of
the scene, still there were heart-burnings.
In that large assemblage several met, who,
though once friends, had not spoken for years,
and who felt startled and uneasy at being
brought into such close proximity. But scarcely
a shadow could be cast where the beautiful
hostess moved and spoke—</p>

<p class="center">“Thought in each glance, and mind in every smile.”</p>

<p>There was so much frankness in every kind
and earnest word she said, joined to the charm
of her gentle and courtly manners, that the
coldest, the most obtuse, the most reserved, felt
moved and interested beyond themselves, and
more cordially inclined to all the world beside.</p>

<p>And Marion was there, whose flowers were
the only ornament on Edith’s snowy dress;
but she, usually so gay, was thoughtful almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
to sadness, and looked anxiously into her husband’s
face as they stood for a few moments
apart—“I believed that of late years my father
never mixed in such scenes as these,” said he.
“Edith could not have thought he would come
when she invited us.”</p>

<p>“I knew how it was to be,” said Marion;
“there are many here to-night whom she hopes
to bring together again; rich and poor. See,
she is looking towards us now, while speaking
to him! Oh, Edward, go up to them at once,
I entreat you!” exclaimed she earnestly.</p>

<p>“Not before so many people,” said her husband
with emotion. “Suppose he were to
refuse my hand?”</p>

<p>Marion sighed: but her hopeful nature
whispered that the New-Year’s Eve was not
yet ended. And now a clock of silvery tone
chimed and struck the hour of midnight.
The guests were conducted to supper: unseen
harps, and sweet voices, gave a slow farewell to
the old year, as they were seating themselves
at the upper end of the hall, and then burst
forth into a joyful welcome to the new, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
villagers entered and took their places at the
lower range of tables; this again died away,
and a sweet strain arose, of the softest prayer,
for peace and happiness to all! Marion looked
round with emotion.</p>

<p>It was a lovely scene, that huge banquet-hall,
with its gay wreaths of holly and flowers.
The bright assemblage of guests; the happy
faces of the villagers below; the beautiful
hostess, seated in an antique chair at the upper
end, with the banners of her ancient race,
trophies of ages long gone by, waving behind
her; the lovely figure of Peace below, almost
shrouded in the dark leaves, and forming a
striking contrast to those warlike emblems:
all these afforded a sight which, once beheld,
would not be easily forgotten.</p>

<p>After each guest had paid sufficient homage
to the choice viands before them, Edith took
up a cup of curious workmanship; her face
was radiant with kindness and love as she
looked on those around her.</p>

<p>“This cup has been possessed, for many a
century, by my ancestors,” she said; “preserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
for ages as a venerated relic: doubtless
many a toast has been pledged in it—many a
friendly welcome expressed; but I believe no
more cordial and sincere one than that with
which I greet you all this night. I would fain
express the usual wish of a new-year of all
imaginable happiness and prosperity, but as
such have never visited this earth, we know it
would be vain; and I therefore wish you the
greatest of all blessings—that which cheers
and supports us in the sorrows of life, and
heightens beyond measure its pleasures and
enjoyments,—love and harmony in your hearts
and homes! There may be some among us
estranged from friends and kindred, grieving
over the fault, (for few, let us hope, in a
Christian land, can live unmoved in enmity
one with another,) and yet hanging back, in
mistaken pride or want of moral courage, from
the few conciliatory words which would, in
most cases, suffice for a perfect reconciliation.
The old year is now passing away—may it
bear with it all anger, all animosity! May
those few healing words be spoken,—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Peace, and Love, and Charity be with us
all!”</p>

<p>Edith’s voice trembled with emotion, but
she did not perceive the agitation of many
of her guests, for her eyes were fixed, as
if in a dream, on the lower end of the hall.
There was a movement of surprise among those
seated there: she made her way, she knew not
how, through them all. Yes, it was Percy!—One
look, expressing a thousand emotions, and
their hands were clasped in each other! For
an instant her lovely head was bowed before
him, while a few large, heavy tears, fell on
the flowers at her feet! But she soon mastered
her emotion, and, with a face radiant
with joy, led him through the crowd of sympathising
faces to her mother’s side. In the
short silence which ensued, the bells of the
village church were plainly heard ringing-in
the new-born year! When had they ever
sounded so sweetly before?</p>

<p>And now a joyous strain again burst forth,
and all returned to the ball-room. Again the
young, the beautiful, the gay, joined in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
dance; and never feet flew more lightly than
theirs. But there were those who felt a deeper
joy; the serene, the heavenly one of Reconciliation!</p>

<p>And Percy and Edith once more stood side
by side,—united, happy! And Marion told
her wondering friend how Percy (who was an
old college friend of her husband’s) had come
to see them that morning, and in their quiet
home had confessed that he was drawn to
them by the desire of obtaining news of her,
round whom his deep true love still lingered
with so much regret. She had tried to persuade
him to accompany them that night, but
still he doubted—still feared. Yet he now
confessed to Edith how, when they were gone,
he had longed to see her face again, how he
had concealed himself in the crowd, and how
he had been moved, by what she had just said,
to rush forward from the recess where he
stood unobserved, that he might be the first
to own the gentle Magic of those words!</p>

<p>And many others had felt them too!
Marion was leaning on <i>her father’s</i> arm—her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
eyes cast down and tearful in their joyfulness,
as he spoke to her in a low tone of the invalid
whom she must see on the morrow.</p>

<p>And all hearts were touched and softened,
and rich and poor felt drawn closer together!
And they thought of the voice that had said,—“Love
one another as I have loved you,”—and
of the divine lessons of peacefulness and
long-suffering which some had forgotten!
And many blessed to the end of their days
the Magic Words spoken by the Peacemaker<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
on that New-year’s Night.</p>
